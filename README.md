# Empirical analysis of Sorting Algorithms in Python

## Prerequirements

1. uv package manager needs to be installed.
2. required python version needs to be installed specified in `.python-version` file.

## How to run

To run empirical benchmarking for every sorting algorithm with preconfigured inputs

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Avaitable sorting algorithms for benchmarking

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Selection sort
